                Many teens struggle with their mental health and find it hard to stay focused. 
                Some teens may even fall behind on school work or not show up to school due to the state of their mental health. 
                Mental health is important to take care of because it is what keeps you functioning.
                If you think your mental health isn't at its best take a break and figure out why.
                You could go for a walk, write down some thoughts and even draw or take a nap to relax.
                If you think your mental help is at a really bad state consider talking to an adult or seeking help.
